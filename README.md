# Calendar App

## Development Steps

1. Rename the file **`env.template`** to **`.env`**
2. Update environment variables with your desired values.
3. Run the project locally using:  **`yarn dev`**
4. If you want to test API requests locally set the following environment variable in your **`.env`** file:
```
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```
You can find the backend API written in Node.js [here](https://github.com/martinfort1/React-Calendar-Backend).
